# wallbreaker
This is one of my "older" projects.
It was my first proper c# program.
I knew C# for around 2 months when I wrote it.
Almost all of the text parts of the code are in hungarian because it was a task at the university where i studied.
They liked their codes in hungarian somewhat better.

This is a console application,
There are 2 players: a builder and a destroyer,
The builder's task is to fill every cell of the map with colored cells.
The destroyer's task is to clear the map of colored cells.

Players move with the cursor left and right arrows, and place/shoot with the Enter key.

*There is a known bug when the game is played with X != Y side lengths, please play with x=y side lengths (eg.: 4*4 or 7*7).
